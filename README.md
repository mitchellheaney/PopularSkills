# PopularSkills :chart:

## Project Description:

This application extrapolates/web scrapes current Data Analyst jobs via SerpAPI queries, and then reports this data 
back to the user with the most popular skills in demand within the industry. Using the critical data processing steps of 
exploratory collection, cleaning then visualising data, this project abides to data formats to abstain from redundant data entries. 
This yields realistic and up-to-date data for users.

## Technologies Used: 
- Python :snake:
- AWS S3 :thought_balloon:
- SerpApi :robot:
- Streamlit Frontend Provider :computer:

## Problem to Solve: :monocle_face:

PopularSkills aims to assist aspiring Data Analysts with knowledge of relevant skills wanted by
employers in the industry. It tries to minimise confusion for users in not knowing what skills to learn
and master 

## Future Plans/Obstacles:
The application can be easily extensible for alternate occupations depending on queries sent to SerpAPI.
An integral learning process in this project was handling pandas data structures whilst communciating data with
other tech like Amazon S3 and Streamlit dataframes. I plan to migrate data to a sustainable database into
SQL whilst still scrapping real-time job postings.
